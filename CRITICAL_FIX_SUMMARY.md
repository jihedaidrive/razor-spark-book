# CRITICAL FIX: Confirmed Reservations Not Showing in Booking Calendar

## The Problem
After admin confirms a reservation in Dashboard, when client goes back to `/booking`, the confirmed slot still appears as available (green) instead of reserved (red).

## Root Cause Found
The issue was in `fetchReservations()` function in Booking.tsx:

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
const fetchedReservations = await reservationsService.getReservations({
  date: startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0], // ❌ Only today's reservations
  barberName: selectedBarber || undefined,
});
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
const params: any = {};
if (selectedBarber) {
  params.barberName = selectedBarber;
}
// ✅ Fetch ALL reservations (no date filter)
const fetchedReservations = await reservationsService.getReservations(params);
```

## Why This Fixes It

1. **WeeklyCalendar shows full week** - needs reservations for all 7 days
2. **Previous code only fetched today's reservations** - missing confirmed slots from other days
3. **Dashboard.tsx works correctly** because it fetches ALL reservations: `getReservations({})`
4. **Now Booking.tsx matches Dashboard.tsx behavior** - fetches all reservations

## The Flow (Fixed)
1. Client books appointment → status: "pending"
2. Admin confirms in Dashboard → status: "confirmed" 
3. Client returns to Booking page → **NOW CORRECTLY SHOWS**:
   - ✅ Fetches ALL reservations (including confirmed ones)
   - ✅ WeeklyCalendar receives confirmed reservation
   - ✅ Switch statement shows "Confirmed" (red, disabled)
   - ✅ Slot appears as unavailable

## Additional Improvements
- Added debug info panel to troubleshoot issues
- Enhanced logging to track reservation fetching
- Consistent behavior between Dashboard and Booking pages

## Test Verification
1. Book appointment as client → shows "Pending" (yellow)
2. Confirm as admin in Dashboard → shows "Confirmed" (red)
3. Return to Booking page → slot should now show "Confirmed" (red, disabled)
4. Try different barbers/dates → all confirmed slots show correctly
